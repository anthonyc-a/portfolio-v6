            Iâ€™m a freelance web designer and developer with 5+ years experience
            in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript ES5+.
            <br />
            <br />
            I currently use web frameworks such as Gatsby JS and Next JS (React)
            to generate sites and interfaces.
            <br />
            <br />
            The majority of my time is spent designing and building fast,
            responsive websites for small and medium sized businesses. I focus
            on clean design and robust code to improve visitor conversion and
            customer retention.
